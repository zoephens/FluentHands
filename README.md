## About the Project
The primary focus of this project is to enable educators to define learning outcomes for quizzes administered to their students. The system must accurately identify various Jamaican Sign Language (JSL) signs from images and gestures performed by students to assist educators in evaluating performance and providing real-time feedback. As well as the system must organize each student's performance data in a constructive manner for teachers to easily overview and make informed inferences about student progress.
